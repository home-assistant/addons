# Home Assistant Add-on: DuckDNS

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "DuckDNS" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Visit [DuckDNS.org](https://www.duckdns.org/) and create an account by logging in through any of the available account services (Google, Github, Twitter, Persona, Reddit).
2. In the `Domains` section, type the name of the subdomain you wish to register and click `add domain`.
3. If registration was a success, the subdomain is listed in the `Domains` section along with `current ip` being the public IP address of the device you are currently using to access `duckdns.org`. The IP address will be updated by the DuckDNS add-on.
4. In the DuckDNS add-on configuration, perform the following:
    - Copy the DuckDNS token (listed at the top of the page where account details are displayed) from `duckdns.org` and paste into the `token` option.
    - Update the `domains` option with the full domain name you registered. E.g., `my-domain.duckdns.org`.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
lets_encrypt:
  accept_terms: true
  certfile: fullchain.pem
  keyfile: privkey.pem
token: sdfj-2131023-dslfjsd-12321
domains:
  - my-domain.duckdns.org
aliases: []
seconds: 300
```

Additionally, you'll need to configure the Home Assistant Core to pick up the SSL certificates. This is done by setting the following configuration for the [HTTP][HTTP] integration configuration in your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
http:
  ssl_certificate: /ssl/fullchain.pem
  ssl_key: /ssl/privkey.pem
```

### Option group `lets_encrypt`

The following options are for the option group: `lets_encrypt`. These settings
only apply to Let's Encrypt SSL certificates.

#### Option `lets_encrypt.accept_terms`

Once you have read and accepted the Let's Encrypt [Subscriber Agreement](https://letsencrypt.org/repository/), change value to `true` in order to use Let's Encrypt services.

#### Option `lets_encrypt.certfile`

The name of the certificate file generated by Let's Encrypt. The file is used for SSL by Home Assistant add-ons and is recommended to keep the filename as-is (`fullchain.pem`) for compatibility.

**Note**: _The file is stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Home Assistant_

#### Option `lets_encrypt.keyfile`

The name of the private key file generated by Let's Encrypt. The private key file is used for SSL by Home Assistant add-ons and is recommended to keep the filename as-is (`privkey.pem`) for compatibility.

**Note**: _The file is stored in `/ssl/`, which is the default for Home Assistant_

#### Option `lets_encrypt.algo`

Public key algorithm that will be used.

Supported values: `rsa`, `prime256v1` and `secp384r1`. 

The default is `secp384r1`


### Option: `ipv4` (optional)

By default, Duck DNS will auto detect your IPv4 address and use that.
This option allows you to override the auto-detection and specify an
IPv4 address manually.

If you specify a URL here, contents of the resource it points to will be
fetched and used as the address. This enables getting the address using
a service like https://api.ipify.org/ or https://ipv4.text.wtfismyip.com

### Option: `ipv6` (optional)

By default, Duck DNS will auto detect your IPv6 address and use that.
This option allows you to specify an interface name from which the IPv6 address should be retrieved.
You can also override the auto-detection and specify an
IPv6 address manually.

Retrieving the IPv6 address over a URL is not supported.

### Option: `token`

The DuckDNS authentication token found at the top of the DuckDNS account landing page. The token is required to make any changes to the subdomains registered to your account.

### Option: `domains`

A list of DuckDNS subdomains registered under your account. An acceptable naming convention is `my-domain.duckdns.org`.

### Option: `aliases` (optional)

A list aliases of domains configured on the `domains` option.
This is useful in cases where you would like to use your own domain.
Create a CNAME record to point at the DuckDNS subdomain and set this value accordingly.

For example:

```yaml
domains:
  - my-domain.duckdns.org
aliases:
  - domain: ha.my-domain.com
    alias: my-domain.duckdns.org
```

Don't add your custom domain name to the `domains` array. For certificate creation, all unique domains and aliases are used.

Also, don't forget to make sure the dns-01 challenge can reach Duckdns. It might be required to add a specific CNAME for that:

```
CNAME _acme-challenge.<own-domain>    _acme-challenge.<domain>.duckdns.org
CNAME                 <own-domain>                    <domain>.duckdns.org
```

### Option: `seconds`

The number of seconds to wait before updating DuckDNS subdomains and renewing Let's Encrypt certificates.

## Known issues and limitations

- To log in, DuckDNS requires a free account from any of the following services: Google, Github, Twitter or Persona.
- A free DuckDNS account is limited to five subdomains.
- At time of writing, Duck DNS' own IPv6 autodetection
  [does not actually work][duckdns-faq], but you can use the URL option
  for `ipv6` to get around this, read on.
