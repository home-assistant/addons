## About

This add-on wraps around the `telldus-core` package to expose a service
for your TellStick and TellStick Duo.

This integration allows users to add switches, lights, and sensors which are
communicating with 433 MHz. There are a number of vendors (Capidi Elro,
Intertechno, Nexa, Proove, Sartano, and Viking) who are selling products that
work with TellStick.

For more details, please check the TellStick [protocol list][protocol-list].
