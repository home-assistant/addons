configuration:
  beam_size:
    name: Beam size
    description: >-
      Number of candidates to consider simultaneously during transcription (0 =
      auto).  Increasing the beam size will increase accuracy at the cost of
      performance.
  language:
    name: Language
    description: >-
      Language to pre-load model for during start-up.
  model:
    name: Model
    description: |
      Whisper model that will be used for transcription (faster-whisper only).

      The default model is `tiny-int8`, a compressed version of the smallest
      Whisper model which is able to run on a Raspberry Pi 4. Compressed models
      (`int8`) are slightly less accurate than their counterparts, but smaller
      and faster.
  custom_model:
    name: Custom model
    description: |
      Path to a converted model directory, or a CTranslate2-converted Whisper
      model ID from the HuggingFace Hub like
      "Systran/faster-distil-whisper-small.en".

      If custom_model_type is set to 'transformers', a HuggingFace transformers
      Whisper model ID from HuggingFace like 'openai/whisper-tiny.en' may be
      used.
  custom_model_type:
    name: Custom model type
    description: |
      Type of Whisper model expected from custom model.

      The default is 'faster-whisper' which requires a CTranslate2-converted
      Whisper model. If set to 'transformers', a HuggingFace transformers-based
      Whisper model may be used.

      Overrides `stt_library` when `custom_model` is set.
  initial_prompt:
    name: Initial prompt
    description: >-
      Description of audio that can help Whisper transcribe unusual words
      better.
  stt_library:
    name: Speech-to-text library
    description: >-
      Speech-to-text backend library to use.

      The default `auto` will select the best backend/model based on
      language/hardware.

      Overridden by `custom_model_type` when `custom_model` is set.
  debug_logging:
    name: Debug logging
    description: >-
      Print DEBUG level messages to the app's log.
