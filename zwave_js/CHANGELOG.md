### Config file changes

- Correct firmware version condition for Zooz ZSE40 v3.0

### Detailed changelogs

- [Z-Wave JS 12.4.0](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.4.0)

### Detailed changelogs

- [Z-Wave JS 12.3.1](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.3.1)

## 0.4.0

### Features

- Add-On: Provide access to Z-Wave JS cache files for debugging in `/addon_configs/core_zwave_js/cache`
- Add-On: Add configuration option to log to file. When enabled, logs will be written to `/addon_configs/core_zwave_js` with the `.log` file extension

## 0.3.0

### Features

- Add-On: Add `disable_controller_recovery` configuration option. When enabled, the driver will not attempt to automatically recover from an unresponsive controller and will instead either let the controller recover on its own or wait for the user to restart the add-on to attempt recovery. This is an advanced configuration option that should not be adjusted in most cases and is therefore hidden from the default view.

### Bug fixes

- Z-Wave JS: Ensure the default Basic CC values are only exposed if they should be
- Z-Wave JS: Auto-remove failed SmartStart nodes when bootstrapping times out

### Detailed changelogs

- [Z-Wave JS 12.2.3](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.2.3)
- [Z-Wave JS 12.2.2](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.2.2)
- [Z-Wave JS 12.2.1](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.2.1)
- [Z-Wave JS Server 1.33.0](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server/releases/tag/1.33.0)

## 0.2.0

### Features

- Add-on: Add `safe_mode` configuration option to put Z-Wave network in safe mode. This can be used help with troubleshooting network issues, such as being unable to start it, but will likely slow down your network and should therefore be used sparingly. This is an advanced configuration option that should not be adjusted in most cases and is therefore hidden from the default view.
- Add-on: Switch to [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). With this change, major version changes to the addon will now reflect e.g. a major version release of Z-Wave JS or a significant change to the add-on structure. This should help users better understand the potential impact of an upgrade.

### Bug fixes

- Z-Wave JS: Includes several more fixes and workarounds for the problematic interaction between some controller firmware bugs and the automatic controller recovery introduced in the `v12` release

## 0.1.95

### Bug fixes

- Z-Wave JS: Fixes or works around multiple issues with 500 series controllers that could trigger the unresponsive controller detection in Z-Wave JS 12 in situations where it was not necessary, causing restart loops.


### Bug fixes

- [Z-Wave JS 12.0.3](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.0.3)

### Detailed changelog

- [Z-Wave JS 12.0.1](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.0.1)
- [Z-Wave JS 12.0.2](https://github.com/zwave-js/node-zwave-js/releases/tag/v12.0.2)

## 0.1.93

### Bug fixes

- Z-Wave JS Server: For users that have opted in to data collection in their Home Assistant Z-Wave configuration, a missing return caused the server to try to soft reset the controller during Home Assistant startup for Home Assiststant versions 2023.9.x or less. This has now been resolved.

### Detailed changelog

- [Z-Wave JS Server 1.32.1](https://github.com/zwave-js/zwave-js-server/releases/tag/1.32.1)

## 0.1.92

### Bug fixes

- Add-on: Revert change to stop rebuilding @serialport/bindings-cpp from source as the problem is fixed on some CPU platforms but not all

## 0.1.91

### Breaking changes

- Z-Wave JS: Firmware updates may no longer work properly in Home Assistant versions 2023.9.x and earlier due to a breaking change upstream that couldn't be made backward compatible, but will work once again starting in 2023.10.0. This breaking change ultimately improves firmware updates, as checking for updates no longer requires communication with the device, therefore reducing the risk of corrupting manufacturer information. This also means that updates for battery-powered devices can be detected without waking up the devices.

### Features

- Z-Wave JS: Unresponsive controllers are now detected and automatically restarted if possible.
- Z-Wave JS: Battery-powered devices are sent back to sleep after 250 ms with no command (down from 1000 ms). This should result in significant battery savings for devices that frequently wake up.
- Add-on: We no longer rebuild the @serialport/bindings-cpp package from source.

### Bug fixes

- Z-Wave JS: A bug in the 7.19.x SDK has surfaced where the controller gets stuck in the middle of a transmission. Previously, this would go unnoticed because the failed commands would cause the nodes to be marked dead until the controller finally recovered. Since v11.12.0, however, Z-Wave JS would consider the controller jammed and retry the last command indefinitely. This situation is now detected, and Z-Wave JS attempts to recover by soft resetting the controller when this happens.
- Z-Wave JS: Fixed an issue where supporting controllers would no longer be automatically restarted after failing to do so once.
- Z-Wave JS: Devices that send notifications from endpoints, like Aeotec Wallmote, are now properly supported.

### Config file changes

- Add warnings about broken controller firmware versions
- Add Heatit Z-Water 2
- Add Shelly Wave 1PM
- Add Heatit Z-TRM6
- Increase poll delay for ZW500D
- Add fingerprint for Simon IO Master Roller Blind
