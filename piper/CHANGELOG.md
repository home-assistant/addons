# Changelog

## 2.5.2

- Upgrade to `wyoming-piper` 2.5.2
- Add Japanese (OpenJTalk) and Thai (TLTK) support behind the new
  `enable_japanese` and `enable_thai` options, and the Thai voice they enable
  (`th_TH-tsync2-medium`)
- Japanese and Thai voices are hidden from Home Assistant until their option is
  turned on. They used to be offered and then produce silence
- A voice that fails to synthesize now reports why instead of returning empty
  audio
- An interrupted voice download is retried on the next start instead of leaving
  a truncated file that stayed broken until it was deleted by hand
- Voice models are included in backups again. They were skipped because they
  were only re-downloadable copies, but voices can now be uploaded and deleted
  from the web interface, so which ones are installed is your choice and an
  uploaded voice exists nowhere else. Large re-downloadable caches are still
  skipped
- Add 1 new Estonian voice (`et_EE-news-medium`)
- Japanese, Thai and OmniVoice are downloaded when their option is turned on
  rather than shipped in the app image, which keeps the image at roughly its
  previous size instead of growing to ~2 GB. The download is cached in `/data`
  and reused on later starts
- Add a voice management web interface, available through the app's "Open Web
  UI" button (ingress). Upload and delete custom Piper voices, and upload
  OmniVoice cloning voices, without needing file access to `/share`. Only Home
  Assistant's ingress proxy is allowed to reach it
- Add a `backend` option to switch between `piper` (default) and the
  experimental `omnivoice` backend. OmniVoice is higher quality and supports
  voice cloning, but is much slower and really wants a desktop or server CPU;
  it runs elsewhere with a warning, but expect it to be too slow to be useful
- Add an `omnivoice_steps` option to trade OmniVoice quality for speed
- Custom OmniVoice voices are stored in `/data/omnivoice_voices`, kept separate
  from the Piper voice models
- Replace the health check with a Wyoming Describe/Info round trip, which also
  works with the `omnivoice` backend
- Exclude the OmniVoice model and the HuggingFace cache from backups

## 2.3.4
