**Breaking change**: RSA keys generated using the SHA-1 hash algorithm
were disabled by OpenSSH due to a security vulnerability. If you find
your RSA key does not work after update you will need to make a new key
with a stronger algorithm or switch to an ECDSA or Ed25519 type key. For
more information see [OpenSSH v8.8 release notes](https://www.openssh.com/releasenotes.html).
