This Add-on allows you to enable file sharing across different operating systems over a network.
It lets you access your config files with Windows and macOS devices.

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Supervisor** -> **Add-on Store**.
2. Find the "Samba share" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. In the configuration section, set a username and password.
2. Save the configuration.
3. Start the add-on.
4. Check the add-on log output to see the result.

## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
workgroup: WORKGROUP
username: homeassistant
password: YOUR_PASSWORD
interface: ''
allow_hosts:
  - 10.0.0.0/8
  - 172.16.0.0/12
  - 192.168.0.0/16
  - fe80::/10
veto_files:
  - "._*"
  - ".DS_Store"
  - Thumbs.db
compatibility_mode: false
```

### Option: `workgroup` (required)

Change WORKGROUP to reflect your network needs.

### Option: `username` (required)

The username you would like to use to authenticate with the Samba server.

### Option: `password` (required)

The password that goes with the username configured for authentication.

### Option: `interface` (required)

The network interface Samba should listen on for incoming connections.
This option should only be used in advanced cases. In general, setting this
option is not needed.

### Option: `allow_hosts` (required)

List of hosts/networks allowed to access the shared folders.

### Option: `veto_files` (optional)

List of files that are neither visible nor accessible. Useful to stop clients
from littering the share with temporary hidden files
(e.g., macOS `.DS_Store` or Windows `Thumbs.db` files)

### Option: `compatibility_mode`

Setting this option to `true` will enable old legacy Samba protocols
on the Samba add-on. This might solve issues with some clients that cannot
handle the newer protocols, however, it lowers security. Only use this
when you absolutely need it and understand the possible consequences.

Defaults to `false`.
