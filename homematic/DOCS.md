# Home Assistant Add-on: HomeMatic

#### WARNING: This add-on is considered to be obsolete/retired in favor of the much more advanced third-party [RaspberryMatic CCU](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/tree/master/home-assistant-addon) add-on for running a HomeMatic/homematicIP smart home central within HomeAssistant. If you want to migrate to the new add-on, please make sure to update to the latest version of this old "HomeMatic CCU" add-on first and then use the WebUI-based backup routines to export a `*.sbk` config backup file which you can then restore in the new "RaspberryMatic CCU" add-on afterwards (cf. [RaspberryMatic Documentation](https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/wiki/Installation-HomeAssistant))

## Installation

Follow these steps to get the add-on installed on your system:

1. Navigate in your Home Assistant frontend to **Settings** -> **Add-ons** -> **Add-on store**.
2. Find the "HomeMatic CCU" add-on and click it.
3. Click on the "INSTALL" button.

## How to use

1. Properly configure the add-on config (see below).
2. Start the add-on.
3. Check the add-on log output to see if it started successfully.
4. Add homematic to your Home Assistant configuration (also see below).
5. Restart Home Assistant.

If this is set and enabled, the ReGaHss setting will be removed before it will be started.

## Home Assistant configuration

Add the following to your Home Assistant configuration to enable
the integration:

```yaml
homematic:
  interfaces:
    rf:
      host: core-homematic
      port: 2001
    wired:
      host: core-homematic
      port: 2000
    hmip:
      host: core-homematic
      port: 2010
    group:
      host: core-homematic
      port: 9292
      path: /groups
```

## Raspberry Pi3/4

If you use the HM-MOD-RPI-PCB on a Raspberry Pi 3 or 4, you need to add
the following to the `config.txt` file on the boot partition:

```text
enable_uart=1
dtoverlay=miniuart-bt
```

## HmIP-RFUSB

HassOS versions 1.11 and later support the HmIP-RFUSB by default and don't need any
configuration. If you installed Hassio on another distribution of Linux, you need to
follow the installation guide for the UART USB to setup the UART USB interface on
your computer.
