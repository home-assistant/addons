Voice assistant powered by Home Assistant.

Voice assistants are a great way to interact with your house, ask a quick
question, set a timer or control your devices. The more an assistant knows about
you, your home and it’s other inhabitants, the better it is able to help you.

Ada is powered by Almond which is an open, privacy-preserving virtual assistant
that is open source.
