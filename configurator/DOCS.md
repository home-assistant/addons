## Configuration

Add-on configuration:

```yaml
dirsfirst: false
enforce_basepath: false
git: true
ignore_pattern:
  - __pycache__
ssh_keys: []
```

### Option: `dirsfirst` (required)

This option allows you to list directories before files in the file browser tree.

Set it to `true` to list directories first, `false` otherwise.

### Option: `enforce_basepath` (required)

If set to `true`, access is limited to files within the `/homeassistant` directory
(also known as the `/config` folder inside Home Assisant itself).

### Option: `git` (required)

If set to `true`, add-on will initialize git for directories which support it.

### Option: `ignore_pattern` (required)

This option allows you to hide files and folders from the file browser tree.
By default, it hides the `__pycache__` folders.

### Option: `ssh_keys` (required)

A list of filenames containing SSH private keys. These can be used to allow for access to remote git repositories.

### Option: `loglevel` (optional)

The loglevel to pass to hass-configurator (default 'info').
