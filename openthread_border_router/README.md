# Home Assistant Add-on: OpenThread Border Router Add-on

OpenThread Border Router add-on. The add-on uses the upstream OpenThread
Border Router implementation and wraps it as an add-on for Home Assistant.

**NOTE:** This requires a supported 802.15.4 capable radio with OpenThread
RCP firmware. If you are using Home Assistant Yellow or SkyConnect then
the correct firmware is automatically installed.
